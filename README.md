### 3. `Attempts/`
Contains all attempted development of strategies using QuantConnect to Build the portfolio. Quantconnect such sophisiticated systems and portfolio, so a custom backtesting and live trading framework was build.

## Usage

- Add files to their respective directories based on project type.
- Keep notes, backtests, and logs organized within relevant subfolders.
  
## Collaboration

- Please follow the folder structure to maintain organization.
- When adding notes or updates, ensure they're placed in the appropriate category.
- For new projects or datasets, create a corresponding subfolder under the relevant directory.


## Improvements:
- An improvement on the clarity and quality of the code is to have functions in each module, instead of a class containing methods, that would have been much simpler as a way to call each function, as the '__init__' part of each class is not even used making it more difficult to read and use the code for no reason.
