### Layered and Modular Strategy Architecture

The foundation of this framework is a layered structure, where each layer operates independently to accomplish specific tasks. Each layer functions as a self-contained, reusable module, contributing to an automated and efficient trading portfolio management system when combined. This modular design allows flexibility in development and simplifies the process of integrating or refining individual components.

### A Portfolio of Portfolios

In line with insights from Jim Simons, a pioneering figure in quantitative trading, markets can exhibit diverse conditions, with up to eight distinct regimes that can be strategically exploited. This framework envisions a **portfolio composed of multiple sub-portfolios**, where each sub-portfolio is tailored to capture returns from a specific market regime. Within this context, a sub-portfolio represents a collection of **Trading Systems**, each targeting unique conditions within the broader portfolioâ€™s regime-based design.

### Trading Systems

While each sub-portfolio is tailored to a specific regime, it can contain a variety of trading systems, each with distinct advantages, limitations, and market suitability. For instance, a sub-portfolio designed for bullish markets could include several systems such as trend-following, momentum, or other market-appropriate strategies. This diversity enhances adaptability and allows the portfolio to capture value across different dimensions of the target regime.

### Modular Framework

In a modular framework, each module represents an independently developed model that can seamlessly integrate with others. This design maintains consistent outputs across modules while allowing flexibility in inputs and internal logic. This modularity supports individual improvements or modifications within each model without requiring significant changes to other modules, fostering a robust, adaptable, and scalable system.
