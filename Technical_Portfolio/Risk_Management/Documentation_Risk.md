# Risk Management

The **Risk Management** module is a cornerstone of any robust trading system. Without a well-defined approach to managing risk, a trading system cannot be deemed reliable, nor can it be effectively stress-tested. This module performs the critical function of assessing and mitigating various risks associated with trades or portfolios, such as systematic and unsystematic risks, ensuring controlled exposure to potential losses. Key risks considered in this module include tail risk, overconcentration in specific assets, and compliance with market regulations.

## Key Features of the Risk Management Module

### Tail Risk

Tail risk refers to the potential for significant losses caused by rare and extreme market events, such as flash crashes, liquidity crises, or geopolitical shocks. This module identifies tail-risk scenarios and implements strategies to minimize exposure, such as using options, stop-loss mechanisms, or diversification strategies.

### Trade Allocation

This module calculates the optimal allocation for each trade based on prevailing market conditions and key metrics such as:
- **Volatility**: Higher volatility may warrant smaller allocations to manage risk.
- **Market Regime**: Allocations are adjusted depending on whether the market is trending, mean-reverting, or in a transitional phase.
- **Asset Correlation**: Ensures diversification to reduce the impact of overconcentration in highly correlated instruments.

### Overconcentration Monitoring

The module tracks exposure to individual assets or sectors, flagging cases where overconcentration could increase risk. It ensures balanced portfolios by enforcing predefined limits on position sizes.
