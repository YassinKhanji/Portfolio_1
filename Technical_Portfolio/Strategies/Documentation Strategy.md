# Strategy Framework

### Overview

Before diving into strategy building, it's essential to have a clear purpose and structure. A well-defined strategy requires answering three key questions:

1. **What market conditions (or regimes) are we trying to capture?** Are we focusing on trends, mean-reversion, high-volatility periods, or another market behavior?
2. **What type of strategy fits our goal?** Should it be trend-following, mean-reversion, pairs trading, or something else? This choice depends on the regime we want to detect.
3. **What's our trading time horizon?** Will this be a short-term strategy (like intraday or swing trading) or a long-term strategy (like monthly or quarterly positions)?

### Strategy Structure

Building a strategy can be broken down into a few main parts, which act as modules. These modules work together to create a complete trading approach:

1. **Universe Selection**: This is where we define what we’ll trade. Whether it's stocks, bonds, or other assets, the chosen assets should align with the strategy’s goals and expected market behaviors. Also, this step will provide all the necessary data for the next modules.
  
2. **Entry Model**: The entry model gives us signals for when to start a trade. It can be based on technical indicators, statistical patterns, or even machine learning. The goal is to enter trades at the most opportune times.

3. **Risk Management**: Managing risk is crucial. This part covers things like position sizing, stop-losses, and diversification, as well as when to exit a trade. The aim is to protect against large, unexpected losses.

4. **Portfolio Optimization**: Here, we fine-tune the strategy’s parameters to improve its performance. Techniques like Walk-Forward Optimization (WFO) or Reinforcement Learning can help make the strategy more adaptable.

5. **Stress-Testing and Validation**: Rigorous testing, including simulations and scenario analysis, ensures that the strategy can handle real-world challenges like taxes, inflation, and extreme market conditions.

6. **Reporting**: Finally, the reporting module generates performance summaries and visualizations. This includes metrics like returns, risk levels, and drawdowns, so we have a clear picture of how the strategy is doing.

Each of these parts can be treated as an independent model that contributes to a realistic backtesting framework. This modular approach allows us to develop and optimize each part separately and realistically gauge how the strategy might perform in real markets.

### Implementation as a Modular Class

We can implement each strategy as a class where each part becomes its own model. This modularity allows for easy updates and testing:

- **Organized Structure**: The strategy class acts as a wrapper that brings together the different models (entry model, exit model, etc.). Each model has its own logic, which makes the code easier to understand and work with.

- **Flexibility for Future Updates**: If we need to update the entry model or add a new risk measure, we can do that without rewriting the entire strategy. Each component can evolve independently.

- **Automated System Testing**: This modular design even opens up the possibility of creating an automated system to test different combinations of models. Over time, we can use this to find the best-performing setups for different market conditions.

This framework is designed to be adaptable and organized, allowing the strategy to evolve as new ideas and market conditions emerge. The goal is a flexible, efficient, and realistic approach to strategy development that grows with us.
